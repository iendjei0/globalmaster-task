# GLOBAL MASTER task
A clone of the design at hydraulic-master.com done as a recruitment task for GLOBAL MASTER.

## Making process
The website changed and it's different than the design given as a task, so instead for better reference I found a snapshot of the website from the past. I started my work by downloading required pictures from the website. Firstly I thought about how to divide the html, what elements would I need. Secondly I deduced what display types the elements would have (so a vertical flexbox for the banner or a grid for the products list). Then I started to design them one by one with css so they would match the original as well as possible. After everything was done I added the finishing touch of responsivity and slight animations. At last I had to examine how the website looked on different devices with different aspect ratios and display sizes. After adjusting for that the job was done.
